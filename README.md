reprepro with multiple versions support
=======================================

This git repository hosts a branch for reprepro which adds multiple versions
support to it. See [Debian bug #570623](https://bugs.debian.org/570623) for
details and updates.

The upstream repository can be found on https://salsa.debian.org/brlink/reprepro

Release Notes
=============

The multiple-versions patch set adds following features:

* Add shunit2 based tests (Closes: [#857302](https://bugs.debian.org/857302))
* Support multiple versions. (Closes: [#570623](https://bugs.debian.org/570623))
* Add the commands move, movesrc, movematched, movefilter
* Add Limit and Archive option

How to keep multiple versions
-----------------------------

The default behavior of this reprepro is identical to upstream's version. To
keep multiple versions of the same package in the archive, you have to set the
`Limit` option to the desired maximum amount (or to 0 for unlimited). See the
description in the man page for details.

Database layout changes
-----------------------

The database layout changes from the upstream release to the
multiple versions patch set. The difference is as following:

### upstream

* packages.db maps "package name" to "control file" without duplicates
* no packagenames.db

### multiple versions

* packages.db maps "package name|version" to "control file" without
duplicates
* packagenames.db maps "package name" to "package name|version"
allowing duplicates and duplicates sorted by dpkg --compare-versions
descending

The first time the database is opened by reprepro with multiple versions
support, the database will be upgraded from the upstream layout to the multiple
versions layout. *Warning*: There is no way back (but could be done with a
simple Python script)!

Howto rebase
============

1. Rebase the `multiple-versions` branch on top of the updated upstream
`master` branch and push it to https://salsa.debian.org/bdrung/reprepro/

2. Refresh the `multiple-versions-debian` branch by taking the upstream
`debian` branch. Apply patch `debian: Switch to dh` and
`Run shunit2 tests on build time`. Cherry-pick all commits from
`multiple-versions`. Then apply patch `Add trace debugging output`,
`debian: Update changelog` and `Add README.md describing this git branch`.
